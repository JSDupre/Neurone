The objective of this project is to implement the network of neuron described in Brunel's paper\char`\"{}\-Dynamics of Sparsely connected networks of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons\char`\"{}

You first need to set the wanted values to the constants in the \char`\"{}\-Constants.\-hpp\char`\"{} file

Then you need to build the project using the 'make' command in the project directory

Then you can run either the unit tests using './unittest' command or the Neuron simulation using the './\-Neurone' command

note\-: please note that a documentation for the code is available after running doxygen in \char`\"{}html/index.\-html\char`\"{}
